            <p>
                Neoliberalism isn’t just an economic programme. It’s a whole
                world-view, that has very particular ideas about how we should
                live. Over three days, we’ll look at one reading per session,
                covering the ways in which neoliberal ideology tries to turn us
                into competitive entrepreneurs in every aspect of our lives; how it
                tries to convince us that the social elite deserve their privilege;
                and how it even co-opts the language of feminism.

                What would the convergence of the labour movement and the
                ecology movements that Raymond Williams called for in 1984 look
                like today and what are the blockages that need to be overcome?
                How can we ground contemporary eco-socialism in
                anti-imperialist, anti-racist and feminist as well as class
                struggles? We will explore these questions through reading
                texts from Williams, Mies, Jason W. Moore and Raj Patel and
                Andreas Malm.

            <p>
                What is antisemitism? Why has it proved such a longstanding
                feature of European history? Why does it appear at times on the
                left, as the "socialism of fools"? Join us to discuss these
                questions and more through readings of some classic texts on
                the topic, with expert discussion leaders. Following our
                successful Stuart Hall reading group last year, this year at
                The World Transformed we will aim to tackle a crucial question
                facing the left by tapping into our best traditions of
                political education and leftwing anti-racism.
