            <p>
                Neoliberalism isn’t just an economic programme. It’s a whole
                world-view, that has very particular ideas about how we should
                live. Over three days, we’ll look at one reading per session,
                covering the ways in which neoliberal ideology tries to turn us
                into competitive entrepreneurs in every aspect of our lives; how it
                tries to convince us that the social elite deserve their privilege;
                and how it even co-opts the language of feminism.

                What would the convergence of the labour movement and the
                ecology movements that Raymond Williams called for in 1984 look
                like today and what are the blockages that need to be overcome?
                How can we ground contemporary eco-socialism in
                anti-imperialist, anti-racist and feminist as well as class
                struggles? We will explore these questions through reading
                texts from Williams, Mies, Jason W. Moore and Raj Patel and
                Andreas Malm.

                The left needs to understand antisemitism much better in order
                to fight it better. This reading group will explore the history
                of antisemitism and discuss how and why it continues to pollute
                societies today - we will read texts that help us think more
                carefully about the problem of antisemitism and texts that fail
                to grapple with the problem so that we can discuss what's wrong
                with them. The World Transformed doesn't endorse everything in
                these texts, but we will use them to show how the left
                sometimes fails to take antisemitism seriously, as well as the
                limits of some of the thinking about antisemitism today. The
                reading group will allow us to pause for thought, something we
                strongly believe is a vital part of a truly progressive
                politics.
