### Where exactly is the festival taking place?

The festival is taking place in the city of Liverpool across 3 main venues:

* **the Black-E** (1 Great George St, Liverpool L1 5EW)
* **Constellations** (35-39 Greenland St, Liverpool L1 0BS)
* **Hinterlands** (7 Mann St, Liverpool L8 5AF)

They are all within a 15-minute walk from Labour Party Conference.

### What are the accessibility arrangements for the festival?

We can guarantee the following things at TWT:

* Wheelchair accessible venues and arrangements for those with mobility
  requirements
* Child-friendly venues and childcare arrangements
* Some affordable travel, accommodation and food options (and we can research
  accommodation for you, should you have specific requirements)
* An informational pack including further details on event location,
  transport, venues, facilities and parking (to be sent on request)

If you would like to see a more comprehensive accessibility plan, if you would
like to find out more about a certain arrangement, or if you have any
particular accessibility or dietary requirements that you want us to know
about, please get in touch by emailing <logistics@theworldtransformed.org>.

### Can I come to TWT if I’m a Labour Party Conference attendee?

Absolutely! The festival is fully open to Conference delegates and attendees,
and with sessions running every day between 9am and 9:30pm, there is plenty of
festival content for conference-goers to participate in.

### What are my transport options?

There are several different options for transport:

* We have put on a couple of festival coaches going from London - you can buy
  single or return tickets online
  [here](https://www.tickettailor.com/events/theworldtransformed/186673/).
* If you're on Facebook, we have set up a carpool group
  [here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/twt2018carpool/) where people can
  link up with drivers who are going from the same area as them.
* Most festival goers will book their own transport either by
  [train](https://www.thetrainline.com/), or by
  coach - we would recommend checking out [National Express](https://www.nationalexpress.com/en) and
  [Megabus](https://uk.megabus.com/) if you
  want an option that’s generally cheaper than the train!

### What are my accommodation options?

There are several different options for accommodation:

* We have secured a limited amount of basic communal accommodation for festival
  goers on a budget - you can find out more info and buy tickets online
  [here](https://www.tickettailor.com/events/theworldtransformed/178655/).
* We have set up a small couchsurfing operation in and around Liverpool where
  we will be able to place festival goers who cannot afford other options in
  spare beds/sofas in local residents' homes - you can apply for this
  [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5bzLZULzcCRCPPnoVmTUbKOerzJubuzxOBjXw3eWksL2iTw/viewform). 
* Most festival goers will book their own accommodation in hotels, hostels or
  Airbnbs in and around Liverpool - we would recommend booking this as soon as
  possible.

### Which ticket option should I go for?

We do not police which tickets people decide to buy, we just ask that people
buy whichever ticket they feel they are able to afford. We have a tiered
ticketing system in this way so that no-one is financially shut out of the
festival. For example, every £35 solidarity ticket we sell enables us to
provide one free ticket for those who are unable to afford paid options. So
please help us keep the festival accessible to all by choosing the ticket
option that you are able to afford!

### If I am volunteering, do I need to buy a ticket?

No - if you’ve been confirmed as a TWT volunteer then you do not need a
festival ticket.
